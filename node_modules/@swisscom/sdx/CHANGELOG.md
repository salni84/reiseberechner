- Fixed link to "Accessibility checklist", see SDX-440

### Changed

## [1.21.0] - 2019-04-04
### Info
- sdx.swisscom.ch had almost 1'000 page views during the last week!

## [1.20.2] - 2019-03-21

## [1.17.2] - 2019-02-04

### Added

## [1.17.0] - 2018-12-12
### Added
- `<sdx-select />` is now able to be a multiselect and filterable at the same time, see SDX-122,
  [example](https://sdx.swisscom.ch/samples/select.html)
- Minor fixes in styleguide website, see SDX-268

### Changed
Web Components: renamed all callbacks from "on-something" to "something-callback",
since Angular handles all attributes starting with "on" differently and made it impossible
to use them within templates for SDX consumers (see SDX-325 and SDX-338).
Following components are affected:

- `<sdx-progress-full />`
- `<sdx-select />`
- `<sdx-search />`
- `<sdx-show-more />`

We're really sorry for this inconvenience - but we hope it's somewhat worth the effort since
it's now much easier to integrate the callbacks directly within your Angular template files
(rather than using references and `@ViewChild`),
see the updated [How to add a callback](https://sdx.swisscom.ch/#webcomponents).

## [1.16.0] - 2018-12-06
### Added
- `<sdx-select />` Web Component (including support for grouping, multiple selection and filtering), see SDX-163
- Improved docs for SDX Web Components usage in Angular and Vue,
  see [sdx.swisscom.ch#webcomponents](https://sdx.swisscom.ch/#webcomponents)

### Fixed
- Drastically reduced size of SDX NPM package (~80%), see SDX-342

### To all developers using Web Components in Angular
It's now easier to include SDX Web Components in your app. It's not required anymore to publicly
serve the `webcomponents/` folder and the `webcomponents.js` file (even though this still works).
Please read more: [sdx.swisscom.ch#webcomponents](https://sdx.swisscom.ch/#webcomponents).
Furthermore, it's also documented how to add callbacks within the `components.ts` file.

## [1.15.1] - 2018-11-22
### Fixed
- Removed non-uniform character from CSS

### To all developers
For those of you who reference stylesheets directly, e.g. `import ~@swisscom/sdx/.../menu-flyout`,
please note that because of the SDX Merge cleanup (new SDX Styleguide website), some filenames have been changed:

- `grid/flex` => `grid/grid`
- `menu/menu-context` => `menu/menu-flyout`
- `search/search-input` => `search/search`
- `search/search-live` => `search/search`
- `table/table-data` => `table/table`
- `table/table-display` => `table/table`
- `table/table-generic` => `table/table`

## [1.15.0] - 2018-11-22
### Added
- The SDX Dev and Design parts are now merged in one, to bring Devs and UX closer together and avoid divergency (this affects only the SDX Styleguide website - not the components themselves)

### Fixed

## [1.5.1] - 2018-03-02
### Changed
- Migrated JavaScript to TypeScript, see SDX-45, thanks @raphael.schweikert
  - The generated `sdx*.js` files should be completely backwards compatible.
  - The package now includes typings.
  - Backward incompatible changes:
      1. ES6 modules are no longer available in `src`. If you imported a module directly, the path has changed.

         Old:

         ```javascript
         import Table from 'sdx/js/src/table/Table';
         ```
         New:

         ```javascript
         import Table from 'sdx/dist/es6/table/Table';
         ```
         This can also be simplified to `import Table from sdx/table/Table`.
         With webpack, use the [`resolve.alias` config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias):

         ```javascript
	        {
	          resolve: {
	            alias: {
	              sdx: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/sdx/dist/es6')
	            }
	          }
	        }
         ```
         With TypeScript, put the following in your `.tsconfig.json`’s `compilerOptions`:

         ```javascript
	        {
	          […],
	          "paths": {
	            "sdx": "./node_modules/sdx/dist/es6"
	          }
	        }
         ```
      2. If you used the `esnext:main` (now: `module`) to import SDX, the components will no longer auto-initialize.
